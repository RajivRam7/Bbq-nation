	<h1> ABOUT US</h1>
</center>
<h2><b>WHAT MADE US THIS BIG?</b></h2><p>
BBQ Corporation, based in Louisville, is one of the few brands in india that can boast a rich, decades-long history of success and innovation. It all started with one cook who created a soon-to-be world-famous recipe more than 70 years ago, a list of secret herbs and spices scratched out on the back of the door to his kitchen. That cook was Colonel Harland Sanders, of course, and now National BBQs is the world’s most popular chicken restaurant chain, specializing in that same Original Recipe® along with ExtraCrispy™ chicken, home-style sides and buttermilk biscuits. There are over 20,500  outlets in more than 125 countries and territories around the world. And you know what? There’s still a cook in a kitchen in every last one of them, freshly preparing delicious, complete family meals at affordable prices.</p>
